further implementation of cherry pick.

github repo consist of 3 commits in main branches
-> i pull the code of main branch in local system
->now after checking the commits from git log i copy the hashcode of firsst commit

before pulling the main branch i created a local branch and later in that localsystem branch i cherry pick the 
first commit of main branch which was pulled from github repo
